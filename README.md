# SoupVisualizer
Final capstone project at UNCA 2020

Prequisites:

1) Tensorflow requirements
   1) Ensure you have nvidia drivers
   2) [Follow instructions here (But don't install tensorflow 2.2.0)](https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-gpu-in-ubuntu-20-04-4ee3ca4cb75d)

2) Ensure you have python3 with pip3
3) `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Usage:

1) `python3 UI.py`
2) Due to the somewhat finicky nature of FFmpeg with python, Soup Visualizer only supports .wav files!
3) Spacebar pauses a playing song. Shift-Tab enters windowed mode. 
4) Right clicking a generated song in the UI gives the option to delete that song's saved contents (but not the original copy)
5) For a song to be affected by changes to generation options, the song must be re-processed. The quickest way to do this is to delete the pickle file titled "songname.wav_ellipses.pickle" and press run on the song. 
6) Alternatively, if desired, all parts of the song can be re-processed by selecting the same song from "Select song to process". This includes re-running the Spleeter Neural Network (the long part). 
7) For anybody interested, the split .wav files generated by Spleeter live in SpleeterOutputs_16-bit/5stems. These files may be deleted if desired after the visual files have been generated.
