# SoupVisualizer
Final capstone project at UNCA 2020

Usage:

1) Due to the somewhat finicky nature of FFmpeg with python, Soup Visualizer only supports .wav files!
2) Spacebar pauses a playing song. Shift-Tab enters windowed mode. 
3) Right clicking a generated song in the UI gives the option to delete that song's saved contents (but not the original copy)
4) For a song to be affected by changes to generation options, the song must be re-processed. The quickest way to do this is to delete the pickle file titled "songname.wav_ellipses.pickle" and press run on the song. 
5) Alternatively, if desired, all parts of the song can be re-processed by selecting the same song from "Select song to process". This includes re-running the Spleeter Neural Network (the long part). 
6) For anybody interested, the split .wav files generated by Spleeter live in SpleeterOutputs_16-bit/5stems. These files may be deleted if desired after the visual files have been generated.
